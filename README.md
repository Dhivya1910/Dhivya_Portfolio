## A modern, clean, & simple to navigate portfolio template for web developers (or any developer)!

### Includes Pertinent Sections for any Web Developer Portfolio:
‚úÖ Name & Introduction\
‚úÖ About\
‚úÖ Experience\
‚úÖ Projects / Work\
‚úÖ Contact

To add your own info into the template just alter the `src/portfolio.js` file variables. More customization options will come & be incorporated in the future üîÆ.

If you have any suggestions on what else you want to be customized through the `portfolio.js` file or added / changed in general please feel free to reach out through the hosted page [contact form](https://forms.gle/vhWrKD32i1d2MSZGA) or leave an issue.

If you would like to contribute to the project take a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio/issues).

Want to add a personal touch to the portfolio? Feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio/pulls).

üôè I would greatly appreciate proper credit if you do decided to use this portfolio for any of your purposes. Just leaving the footer as is at the bottom of the template **Designed & Created by Maxim Shelepov** would be enough. Thanks.

‚≠êÔ∏è Also leave a star if you would like to see the project further develop and be improved.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for your development, testing, & eventual deployment. Run all of the commands below in your chosen terminal.

‚ö°Ô∏è **A speedier but less future customizable alternative** would be to [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and then make your updates to the `portfolio.js` file via Github and then committing your changes which will automatically trigger a build process. Check step #2 of [deploy to Github Pages](#To-deploy-on-Github-Pages) for further instructions.

### Preparatory setup
You will need to install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

Using [brew](https://brew.sh) is recommended for mac users.

### Clone the repository
Using the installed global packages from the previous step...
```sh
# Copy this remote repository to your current directory (folder)
git clone https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio.git

# Change into the project folder within your current directory
cd webdev_portfolio
```

### Install necessary project required packages
```sh
npm install
```

## How to Use
Once all is set up, you can start developing by running the vite server and viewing the site from your browser.
### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
```sh
npm run dev

# a localhost:####/webdev_portfolio link should appear -> paste into your browser and view
```

### Make commits and push them to your remote repository
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNMAE/webdev_portfolio.git # set a remote repo for git to point to
git remote -v # shows the set remote

git add . # add all the changes to the stage
git status # shows all the staged changes

git commit -m "Updating portfolio.js content."
git push
```
üéâ Now watch and enjoy as the latest commit appears in your remote repo and the automatic deployment begins. For deployment, check out the [Deployment](#deployment) section.

## Customizing Content

To personalize the template site to your content you can:
1. Populate your own information, appearance settings, & site behavioral setting in [src/portfolio.js](src/portfolio.js).
2. Change the [index.html](index.html) `<title></title>` tag to whatever text you want others to see in the browser tab (ex: name, title, etc.).
3. Add your own `favicon.ico` and `favicon.png` in the `public/` folder or **feel free to use the current emoji favicon** (the icon that will appear in the browser tab next to the title).
4. Optional: Use different global font for the site. You can choose one from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and then replace the import link in the [main.css](src/assets/main.css) file.

```javascript

const greeting = {
    intro: "...",
    message: "...",
    basedLocation: "...",
    resumeLink: "...",
    logoAbsoluteLink: "...",
    portraitAbsoluteLink: "..."
}

const about = { ... }

const experiences = { ... }

const works = { ... }

// ...

```

## Deployment

Firstly, prepare your project for production by running:

```sh
# minify and prepare project for production
npm run build

```

### To deploy on Github Pages
1. Add your cloned repository to github.
    - [Set remote repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#remotes-and-forks) for git to point to & [push commits to remote](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
2. The github workflow `deploy.yml` file should automatically start the build process for deployment to your github pages url: `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>`
    - For confirmation that the build succeeded take a look at the status (check or X) near the latest commit.
    - If permission errors take a look at the settings page and give the github actions permission to **read & write**.
3. Enjoy & Good Luck!

## Technologies Used
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Images and Icons
The images in the [src/assets/images/](https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio/tree/main/src/assets/images) project folder are meant to serve as placeholders for your own images. Please intend to replace them with your own image assets.

The project comes pre-equipped with:
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com) - Offer nice general-purpose icons. 2 icons used in the menu dropdown and 1 link icon for projects.
    ```html
    <template>
        <Bars2Icon class="h-5 w-5 text-blue-500"/> <!-- insert into html like so as a tag -->
    </template>
    <script setup>
    import { Bars2Icon } from '@heroicons/vue/24/solid'
    <script>
    ```
- [fontawesome-icons](https://fontawesome.com) - Using the [font-awesome-brand-icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free&f=brands). 4 used for social media links.
    ```html
    <template>
        <font-awesome-icon icon="fa-brands fa-icon_name_here"></font-awesome-icon>
    </template>
    ```
    More instructions on adding these icons to your templates can be found here in the [icons.js](./src/icons.js) file.

üî≠ Take look at [heroicons basic usage](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons) & [adding icons with fontawesome tutorial](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/vue/add-icons) for more details.

‚ÑπÔ∏è All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. Do not use brand logos for any purpose except
to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.

## Future
Hope to continue improving the site, as well as adding more components and layout options in the `src/components` folder.

**Planned Future Improvements:**
- [ ] Add more layout components to `src/components`.
- [ ] More color scheme styling options in `src/portfolio.js`.
- [ ] More text and animation styling control in `src/portfolio.js`.
