## Getting Started

These intructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for your development and use.

You will need to install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [Node.js](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (which usually comes pre-installed with the latest version of Node.js but if not...)

### Install necessary project required packages

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

From the command line, clone the repository run the project.
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio.git

# Change into the repository within your current directory
cd webdev_portfolio

# install packages - last step
npm install

# Start the vite development server
npm run dev

# Open up the localhost server in your prefered browser

```

## Customizing Sections

To personalize the template to your content and profile change the `src/portfolio.js` file contents. You will also need to change the `index.html` `<title></title>` tag which will display your name in the browser tab. And also don't forget to add your own favicon.ico and favicon.png in the `public` folder.

```javascript

const greeting = {
    intro: "...",
    message: "...",
    basedLocation: "...",
    resumeLink: "...",
    logoAbsoluteLink: "...",
    portraitAbsoluteLink: "..."
}

const about = { ... }

const experiences = { ... }

const works = { ... }

// ...

```

## Deployment

Firstly, prepare your project for production by running:

```sh
# minify and prepare project for production
npm run build

```

### To deploy on Github Pages
- Add your cloned repository to github.
- Go to the settings page of the github repo and change the source to point to the branch of the repo you want to publish (usually main or master), hit save.
- Good Luck!

## Technologies Used
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Future
Hope to continue improving the site, as well as adding more components and layout options in the `src/components` folder.

** Future Improvement Direction: **
- Add more layout components to `src/components`.
- More color scheme styling options in `src/portfolio.js`.
- More text and image styling control in `src/portfolio.js`.
