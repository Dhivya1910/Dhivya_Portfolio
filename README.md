## A modern, clean, & simple to navigate portfolio template for web developers (or any developer)!

### Includes Pertinent Sections for any Web Developer Portfolio:
‚úÖ Name & Introduction\

To add your own info into the template just alter the `src/portfolio.js` file variables. More customization options will come & be incorporated in the future üîÆ.

If you have any suggestions on what else you want to be customized through the `portfolio.js` file or added / changed in general please feel free to reach out through the hosted page [contact form](https://forms.gle/vhWrKD32i1d2MSZGA) or leave an issue.

üôè I would greatly appreciate proper credit if you do decided to use this portfolio for any of your purposes. Just leaving the footer as is at the bottom of the template **Designed & Created by Maxim Shelepov** would be enough. Thanks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for your development and use.

You will need to install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [Node.js](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) (which usually comes pre-installed with the latest version of Node.js but if not install via MacOS [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node#default) or the npm.js homepage)

### Install necessary project required packages

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

From the command line, clone the repository run the project.
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio.git

# Change into the repository within your current directory
cd webdev_portfolio

# install packages - last step
npm install

# Start the vite development server
npm run dev

# Open up the localhost server in your prefered browser

# Set up git locally to push to remote later during deployment stages
git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial Commit."

```

## Customizing Sections

To personalize the template to your content and profile change the `src/portfolio.js` file contents. You will also need to change the `index.html` `<title></title>` tag which will display your name in the browser tab. And also don't forget to add your own favicon.ico and favicon.png in the `public` folder.

```javascript

const greeting = {
    intro: "...",
    message: "...",
    basedLocation: "...",
    resumeLink: "...",
    logoAbsoluteLink: "...",
    portraitAbsoluteLink: "..."
}

const about = { ... }

const experiences = { ... }

const works = { ... }

// ...

```

## Deployment

Firstly, prepare your project for production by running:

```sh
# minify and prepare project for production
npm run build

```

### To deploy on Github Pages
1. Add your cloned repository to github.
    - [Set remote repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#remotes-and-forks) for git to point to & [push commits to remote](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
2. The github workflow `deploy.yml` file should automatically start the build process for deployment to your github pages url: `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>`
    - For confirmation that the build succeeded take a look at the status (check or X) near the latest commit.
    - If permission errors take a look at the settings page and give the github actions permission to **read & write**.
3. Enjoy & Good Luck!

## Technologies Used
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Images and Icons
The images in the [src/assets/images/](https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio/tree/main/src/assets/images) project folder are meant to serve as placeholders for your own images. Please intend to replace them with your own image assets.

The project also comes pre-equipped with [heroicons](https://heroicons.com) package (from the makers of tailwind.css) which allows you to use any other additional general purpose icons in the project. In this project, the menu dropdown uses two such icon.

The social media icons are used link your profiles in connection with the company accounts. Take a look at each of the company logo guidelines for any additional usage details.

‚ÑπÔ∏è All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. Do not use brand logos for any purpose except
to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.

## Future
Hope to continue improving the site, as well as adding more components and layout options in the `src/components` folder.

**Planned Future Improvements:**
- [ ] Add more layout components to `src/components`.
- [ ] More color scheme styling options in `src/portfolio.js`.
- [ ] More text and animation styling control in `src/portfolio.js`.
